# Friend Finder #

Complete a ten question survey to be matched with someone with a compatible personality. :fire:

## What this project does ## 

This project takes in user input from a `form`. After form submission, the app compares user responses with those from other users and displays the user's best overall match in a `modal`. [`Express`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) is used to handle routing and [`Path`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/path.html) works with file and directory paths. New user app data is handled using a `POST` route and all app data can be viewed as a `JSON object` using a `GET` route. `Moment` is used to style the current time. Custom `CSS` (including `media queries`), `JavaScript`, and images are served using `express.static`, built-in middleware functionality in `Express`.

## How users can get started with this project ##
